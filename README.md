# Linear-Regression

In this Project we use Housing Data those availabe in repository or here some information about data set

# **Boston housing data**
Construct a working model which has the capability of predicting the value of houses. The features ‘RM’, ‘LSTAT’ and ‘PTRATIO’ give us quantitative information about each data point. The Target variable, ‘MEDV’ is the variable we seek to predict.

Note:
1) RM: This is the average number of rooms per dwelling.

2) MEDV: This is the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

3) LSTAT: This is the percentage lower status of the population.

4) PTRATIO: This is the pupil-teacher ratio by town

##### Here,We understand what will in Linear regression model file.
First we import libraries that we will use are NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and scikit-learn. Then we Load housing Data from pandas. The pd.read_csv() Method is used for load data set
